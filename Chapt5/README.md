# MarineParasitePhD
## Chapter 5
## Climate change projections

This chapter aims to take the species distribution models from the previous chapter and project them into the future. We will see if there are any general biogeographical changes to parasite/host distribution and compare range size expansions/constrictions across the species.

The chapter is broken down into the write-up (both thesis chapter and journal article), data repository, R code used to download, analyses and visualize data, and the outputs used in the thesis and resulting publications
