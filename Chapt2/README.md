## Marine parasite rates of description

This chapter is a general overview of what data is available online and a basic analysis. 
What I do is download the WoRMS dataset and compare identified parasite discovery dates with those of free-living species. 

The chapter is broken down into the write-up (both thesis chapter and journal article), data repository, R code used to download, analyses and visualize data, and the outputs used in the thesis and resulting publications
