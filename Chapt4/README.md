## Chapter 4
## Parasite biogeography

This chapter aims to compile the species distribution of Chondrichthyans and their parasites and test for any biogeographical trends. I intend to incorporate their host range and phylogenetic host specificity values and get an idea of geographic host specifcity.

The chapter is broken down into the write-up (both thesis chapter and journal article), data repository, R code used to download, analyses and visualize data, and the outputs used in the thesis and resulting publications
